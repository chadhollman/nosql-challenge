# nosql-challenge
This project consisted of creating a database through my terminal using MongoDb and importing data through mongoimport. Through Jupyter Notebook, I added a new document to my collection, updated data types, and dropped unneeded data. In my analysis notebook, I created 4 queries to look up specific businesses and compile them into new Pandas dataframes.
